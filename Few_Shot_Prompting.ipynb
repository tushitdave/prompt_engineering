    "`Few-shot prompting` is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to instruct a language model to perform a specific task using just a few examples or prompts. It enables the model to generalize from the provided examples and apply the learned knowledge to new, similar tasks. This approach is particularly useful when you want the model to perform a task for which it has not been explicitly trained."

    "***Generalization***: After processing the prompt and examples, the model can generalize its understanding of the task and apply it to new, similar inputs. This means the model can perform tasks it hasn't seen before as long as they resemble the examples it was given.\n",

    "***Response Generation***: When presented with a new prompt that aligns with the task, the model generates an output based on its learned understanding from the examples. The generated output is the model's prediction or completion for the given prompt."
